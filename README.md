Exercise - 1:
1. Behavioral Design Pattern
PaymentStrategy.java
Introduction:
This use case demonstrates the Strategy pattern by implementing multiple payment methods (Credit Card, PayPal) that are selected dynamically during checkout in an e-commerce application.

  ObserverPattern.java
  Introduction:
  This example showcases the Observer pattern in a scenario where a stock market ticker notifies multiple investors whenever the stock price changes.

2. Creational Design Pattern
SingletonPattern.java
Introduction:
This example illustrates the Singleton pattern by implementing a single Database connection instance used throughout the application to ensure only one instance of the connection exists.

  FactoryPattern.java
  Introduction:
  This example demonstrates the Factory pattern by using a VehicleFactory to create different types of vehicles (Car, Bike) without exposing the creation logic.

3. Structural Design Pattern
AdapterPattern.java
Introduction:
This use case demonstrates the Adapter pattern by allowing incompatible interfaces (AudioPlayer and AdvancedMediaPlayer) to work together for different media types.

  DecoratorPattern.java
  Introduction:
  This use case illustrates the Decorator pattern by adding extra functionality (Milk, Sugar) to a basic coffee without altering its structure.

Exercise - 2:
This project is a terminal-based Virtual Classroom Manager that handles operations like class scheduling, student enrollment, and assignment submissions. It allows for easy management of virtual classrooms, following SOLID principles and applying design patterns to ensure maintainability and scalability.

Classroom Management: Add, list, and remove virtual classrooms.
Student Management: Enroll students in classrooms and manage them.
Assignment Management: Schedule and submit assignments for each class.
